# Autonomic-OpenCode-CLI

## Overview
This project provides a quick start for OpenCode with agents. It implements an autonomic multi-agent system designed to function like a complete developer department.

## Goals
- **Quick Start**: Get up and running with OpenCode agents immediately.
- **Autonomic System**: Agents work autonomously to complete tasks.
- **Virtual Department**: Simulates roles within a software development team (e.g., Developers, PMs, QA).
